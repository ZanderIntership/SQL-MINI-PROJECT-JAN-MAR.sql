# SQL Practice (Jan) 🧠📊

This repository contains my **January SQL practice** work based on the SQL course material prescribed for those months. It’s a hands-on set of scripts and queries used to reinforce core SQL concepts through a small, realistic dataset. 🗄️✅

## What’s in this repo 📦

- **Database build scripts 🏗️**  
  Scripts to create a sample SQL Server database (`SqlMiniProject`) and the required tables under the `app` schema (Customers, Products, Orders, OrderItems, Payments, Shipments), including keys, constraints, and indexes. 🔑🧱

- **Data seeding scripts 🌱**  
  Insert scripts to generate sample data (customers, products, orders, order items, payments, and shipments) to support repeatable analysis and querying. 🔁🧪

- **Practice queries (Jan) 🧩**  
  A set of queries used to practice and demonstrate topics covered in the courses, including:
  - Aggregations and grouping (e.g., revenue summaries by month/year) ➕📅
  - Joins across multiple tables (customers ↔ orders ↔ payments, orders ↔ shipments, etc.) 🔗
  - `CASE` expressions for classification and quality checks 🏷️✅
  - Filtering and `HAVING` clauses 🎯
  - Simple reporting outputs (status counts, payment-method summaries, delivery outcomes) 📈🧾
  - Basic data validation checks (e.g., delivered vs not delivered consistency) 🔍🚚

## How to use ▶️

1. Run the **database/table creation** script 🏁
2. Run the **insert/seeding** script to generate sample data 🌱
3. Execute the **practice queries** to validate understanding and explore the dataset 🔬

## Tech 🛠️

- SQL Server (T-SQL) 💾
- Schema: `app` 🧩
- Database: `SqlMiniProject` 🗄️
